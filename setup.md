We will be running all code samples today using the [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) environment. If you do not have a Google account you will need to set one up.

I have written some utility code to make some of the sections a little more straight forward. You can check the code out [here](https://github.com/inJeans/c3dis-utils).
