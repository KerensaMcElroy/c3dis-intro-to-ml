What is ML?
- Traditional models are explicitly programmed
-	ML algorithms are learned
-	Therefore data is very important
Exercises:
-	Give some examples of explicit programming
-	Give some examples of machine learning
Why to ML?
-	Data vs. knowledge
-	Predicition vs. understanding
-	Interpretability
-	Applications in science and industry (with examples)
When to ML? (+types)
-	Data requirements
-	Compute requirements
-	Desired outcomes
-	Supervised (labelled data)
-	Unsupervised (unlabelled data)
-	Classification
-	Regression
-	Deep learning
